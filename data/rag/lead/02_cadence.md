# Touchpoint Cadence

Space out follow-ups strategically — not too frequent, not too sparse. 
For digital leads, send an introductory email, then a reminder 3–5 days later, and a final call after two weeks. 
Consistency shows reliability without feeling intrusive. 
Cadence optimization can lift conversions by 10–15%.
