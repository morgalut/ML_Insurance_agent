# Channel Strategy and Guidelines

Match outreach channels to audience behavior. 
Use social ads and online chat for digital leads, and direct calls for agent-assisted leads. 
Ensure message consistency across all channels. 
Omnichannel coordination avoids duplication and boosts perceived professionalism.
