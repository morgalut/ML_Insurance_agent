# Trial and Discount Guidelines

Use short-term discounts or free trial coverage to lower entry barriers. 
Emphasize limited-time offers that create urgency but remain transparent. 
Follow up right before the discount expires to lock in long-term customers. 
Discounts should be easy to activate and cancel to maintain trust.
