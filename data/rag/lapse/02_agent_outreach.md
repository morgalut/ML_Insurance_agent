# Agent Outreach

Encourage agents to personally contact at-risk customers before lapse. 
A human call from a trusted agent builds confidence and reminds customers of the policyâ€™s value. 
Agents should use empathetic, non-pushy language and emphasize loyalty benefits or family protection. 
Timely outreach can recover more than 50% of near-lapse cases.
