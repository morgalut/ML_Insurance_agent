# Smoker Coaching and Health Programs

For smoker segments, combine financial incentives with wellness coaching. 
Offer quit-smoking programs, health-tracking apps, or fitness discounts. 
This increases engagement and demonstrates genuine care, turning a risk factor into a retention opportunity. 
Communication tone should focus on empowerment, not punishment.
