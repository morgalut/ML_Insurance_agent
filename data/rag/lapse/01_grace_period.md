# Grace Period Strategy

When a customer misses a payment, offer a short grace period before policy termination. 
Communicate this extension proactively to reduce anxiety and encourage timely repayment. 
Use automated reminders and multiple payment channels to simplify recovery. 
This small flexibility often prevents lapse without major revenue loss.
